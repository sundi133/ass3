The code executes the BN and answers the query to a given input.

main methods:
Probvalues() :  enumerate for all values of the query variable and normalise finally.
enumerateAsk() :funtion calculate the probability across all variables , marzilisation.
enumerateAll(): enumeate all the distribution and calls itself recursively


Few Traces:
P(rain|sprinkler,grass_wet)=0.006828057
P(rain|sprinkler,~grass_wet)=6.2460883E-4
P(rain|~sprinkler,~grass_wet)=0.07621246
P(rain|~sprinkler,grass_wet)=1.0

The program when exceuted asks for the query variable and then the conditional variables(this should be inputed in comma separated values with ~ as a negation condition for taking negative conditions) 

Any query can be tested given the probabbilities and the network as described in the graph.xml and prob.xml.
